# OPNSense Ansible Playbook

## Personal Notes

1. This Playbook Only Work when we're on Intranet

2. This Playbook Only Work in `uv` python virtual environment we have (`labirin_venv`)

3. In Order to connect to OPNSense API we need to create local hostname (/etc/hosts) with the domain name match with our public domain name in Cloudflare.
